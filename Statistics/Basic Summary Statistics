1.LOADING THE DATASET

1.2 GENERAL
> library(Datasets)
> data(iris) - this creates an object in the environment called 'iris'.

2.SUMMARY STATISTICS

2.1. GENERAL:
> typing iris shows the information on the console
> typing view(iris) shows the information as an easy to read table

2.2. HEAD AND TAIL
> typing head(iris, 4) shows the first 4 rows of the dataset
> typing tail(iris, 4) shows the last 4 rows of the dataset

2.3 SUMMARY()
> summary(iris) will show a statistical summary of the dataset - displaying 
the minimum, maximum, median, etc.
> summary(iris$sepal.length) shows a summary of only the sepal length. The $ defines
which category.
> sum(is.na(iris)) asks R if there are any null values, it returns 0 in this case meaning
there are none. It is important for data cleaning to remove any null values, duplicates,
irrelevant data, etc.

2.4 SKIMR
> Skimr provides more useful tools for data summary - skimr(iris) shows summary information
about the dataset. 

2.5 Group_by
> use dplyr:: to group by
> dplyr is a part of the tidyverse package and helps with dataframe manipulation.
> group_by splits a data frame into a group - useful with variables - this helps
when there is specific data worth looking at in depth
